# **CS 140 Project 1: xv6 Rotating Staircase Deadline Scheduler**

## **Description**
For this collaborative Operating Systems project, we had to augment MIT's xv6 round-robin scheduler with
Con Kolivas' Rotating Staircase DeadLine (RSDL) scheduler. Main languages used are C and x86 assembly. 

The RSDL uses an Active set and an Expired set alongside the process table as scheduling heuristics
to help decide which process to run next in a more fair and heuristic manner.

The Active and Expired sets both have `N` FIFO levels (or queues) in them (think **staircase**).
Each level is given a limited level-local quantum (runtime in ticks) that is decremented as a process in that level runs.
Note that this is more relevant for the Active set. Once a level uses up its entire quantum, all processes in it are ejected and enqueued to
the level below it (level `N-1`) in the exact same order. And once all levels in the Active set uses up their entire quantum, the Active set
is swapped for the Expired set which is then made the new Active set (think **rotation**) with replenished level-local quanta.

Moreover, each process is given a limited process-local quanta.
Upon using up its entire quantum, the process (running in the Active set) moves
down a level (to level `N-1`) where it gets enqueued and its quantum is replenished (think **deadline**).
A process that is selected to run in a set's particular level is then said to be dequeued from that level.
Note that a process begins its life in a predefined level (see `rsdl.h`).

A process that expires at the bottommost level is then moved to the Expired set where it will wait for its next turn.
There are *multiple caveats* here, such as on:
- What happens when a process consumes its entire quantum as it exits (zombie!)?
- What happens when the Active set runs out of processes to run but still has nonzero level-local quanta?
- What happens when a process expires but all the levels below it has no more level-local quanta?

These are all answered in the Project Specs, so you may want to read it for thorough awareness of these caveats.

A high-level view of RSDL is shown below:

## **Collaboration**
I teamed with **Jan Paul Batrina** and **Angelo Convento** for this project.
My role is mainly quality assurance with focus on optimization and debugging.
It was my job to paintstakingly test the kernel for stability and fulfillment of requirements.
Towards this, I wrote a lot of test programs, combed through many output logs, and diligently engaged
in communication with my teammates from suggestions to documentation.
Of course, to proceed with this, I had to have an in-depth understanding of how the xv6 kernel
works in both its original and modified forms.

## **Requirements**
It is suggested for you to only watch the video documentation or skim through the written documentation. 

However, if you really wish to verify the results on your end, the following would be needed.
- Windows 10 or higher
- For high-performance systems, one may use Xilinx Vivado 2021.2 Suite: Download through https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/2021-2.html (will require account registration).
- For low-performance systems, one may use EDA Playground. Web app through https://edaplayground.com/ (will require account registration). Please see Project 2 Specs page 25 for full guide. 
- Minimal space and at least 4 GB memory for EDA playground. At least 70 GB of space and 8 GB of memory for Xilinx Vivado.

**Remark:** Please note that this project was accomplished through Vivado.

## **Running Simulations**
This guide will only focus on the Vivado platform. Analogous steps can be expected in EDA Playground.
1. Start Vivado. Complete the set-up and account registration process.
2. Once Vivado is started, open an existing workbench through File. Select the following directory in your clone of this repository: `CS21_Project2_v2\`. This step will load all Design and Simulation sources to your Vivado session.
3. Once the workbench has loaded, you may begin testing the added instructions. Select the appropriate testbench for the desired instruction that you will test in the Sources pane, right click it, and select "Move to top".
4. Reorder the hiearchy of files by refreshing the Sources pane.
5. Open `memfile.mem` in the Vivado Sources pane, and its contents will appear in a tab the Vivado Editor panel.
6. Copy the contents of the desired instruction test from `Instruction Tests\` to `memfile.mem` (overwrite it).
7. Finally, hit Simulate from the Menu Bar. This will produce a waveform diagram that you may examine for any errors (as we did in the documentation). You may also watch the TCL Console panel for any issues (the testbench is very verbose).

## **Sample I/O**
For testing, say, the sll instruction, you will open `Instruction Tests\sll memfile.txt` and copy its machine code contents to your `memfile.mem` (also shown below).
```
2010000c
00108200
00108200
00108200
2210000c
ac100054
```
An assembly translation of that machine code can be found in  `Instruction Tests\sll tester.asm`. Simulating the workbench with the appropriate testbench on top (`sll_testbench.sv`) will then produce the following waveform diagram (truncated to only show the last few cycles):
![sll_waveform.png](sll_waveform.png)

As expected, the diagram is clean and error-free. The TLC Console panel would also accompany this with a "Success" message. Video documentation includes a full discussion of the entire waveforms.

## **xv6 Credits**
xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

ERROR REPORTS

We switched our focus to xv6 on RISC-V; see the mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git
repository on github.com.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
